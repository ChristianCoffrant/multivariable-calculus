\begin{enumerate}

\item Model motion in the plane using parametric equations. In particular, how do you describe circles, ellipses, and lines using parametric equations.
\item Be able to convert between rectangular and polar coordinates. 
\item Graph polar functions in the plane. Find intersections of polar equations, and illustrate that not every intersection can be obtained algebraically (you may have to graph the curves).
\item Find derivatives, tangent lines, area, arc length, and surface area using parametric and polar equations.

\end{enumerate}
