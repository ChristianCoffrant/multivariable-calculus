%\item ...
%\end{enumerate}


\begin{enumerate}
\item Be able to describe cylinders and quadric surfaces in space.
\item Describe uses for function with varying input and output
  dimensions.  Be able to draw appropriate representations when the
  input and output dimensions are 3 or less. Recognize by name and
  graph the different types of functions, in particular parametric
  equations, space curves, functions of several variables, vector
  fields, transformations, and parametric surfaces.
\item Find derivatives of space curves, and use the derivative to find
  tangent lines to space curves.
\item Find equation for a vector field given a description of the vectors.
\end{enumerate}
