% A list of objectives for the chapter
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item ...
%\end{enumerate}


\begin{enumerate}
\item Explain how to setup surface integrals, as well as how to
compute surface area.
\item Explain how to set up and compute triple
  integrals, as well as how to interchange the bounds of
  integration. Use these ideas to find volume.
\item For surfaces and solid regions, find area,
  mass, centroids, center of mass, moments of interia, and radii of
  gyration.
\item Explain how to change coordinate systems in integration, in
  particular to polar, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates. Explain
  what the Jacobian of a transformation is and how to use it.
