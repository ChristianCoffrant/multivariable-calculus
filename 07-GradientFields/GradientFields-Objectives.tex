%\begin{enumerate}
%\item ...
%\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Compute work done by a non-constant force $\vec F$ along a
  non-straight curve $C\colon\vec r(t)$. Use this idea to define flow and
  circulation along a curve.  Be able to compute flow along piecewise
  smooth curves. Give an application of flow in terms of fluid flow.
\item Compute the flux in the plane of a vector field $\vec F$ across
  a smooth curve $C\colon\vec r(t) = \langle x(t),y(t)\rangle$.  Give an
  application of flux in terms of fluid flow.
\item Be able to draw vector fields, determine if a given field is a
  gradient field (hence conservative), and use the fundamental theorem
  of line integrals to greatly simplify work calculations.
