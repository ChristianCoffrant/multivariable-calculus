%\subsection{Preparation Problems}

%Here are the preparation problems for this unit.

\subsection{Homework}

In the following list, the ``basic practice'' problems should be quick
problems to help you master the ideas.  The ``good problems'' will
require a little more work.  The theory and application problems are
ones that will challenge you more; make sure you do the problems from
this area to fully master the material.
