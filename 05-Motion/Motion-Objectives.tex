\begin{enumerate}
\item Describe projectile motion.  Develop formulas which are valid if
  we neglect air resistance and consider only acceleration due to
  gravity.  Use your model to develop formulas for the range, maximum
  height, and flight time.
\item Develop the $TNB$ frame for describing motion. Add to your model
  the concepts of curvature, osculating circle, torsion, and the
  tangential and normal components of acceleration. Be able to prove
  the relationships that you develop in the $TNB$ frame.
