\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the equation of a plane through $(1,0,0)$, $(2,0,-1)$, $(0,1,3)$.
\item Find the equation of a plane containing the lines $\langle 1+t, 3t, 2\rangle$ and $\langle 2+2t, 3, 2-t\rangle$.
\item Find a point on the plane $3x-2y+z=2$.
\item Sketch the planes $2x+3y+z=6$, $x-4y=8$, and $\frac{x}{2}+\frac{y}{3}+z=1$.
\item Two of these points are on the same side of the plane $3x+2y-2z=0$.  Which two are they?  $(10,3,2)$, $(-2,5,3)$, $(-2,5,1)$ (Hint: don't sketch the planes.)
\item Given a point $Q$ and a plane with normal vector $\vec n$ and containing point $P$, find the (shortest) distance from the point to the plane.  Draw a diagram illustrating what is going on.
\item Given a point $Q$ and a line with direction vector $\vec v$ containing point $P$, find the distance from $Q$ to the line.  Draw a diagram illustrating what is going on.
\item Given a line with direction vector $\vec v_1$ containing $P_1$, and another line with direction vector $\vec v_2$ containing $P_2$, find the distance between the two lines. Draw a diagram illustrating what is going on.
