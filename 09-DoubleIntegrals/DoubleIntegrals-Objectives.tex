% A list of objectives for the chapter
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item ...
%\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Explain how to setup and compute a double integrals, as well as
how to interchange the bounds of integration. Use these ideas to find
area and volume.
\item For planar regions, find area, mass, centroids, center of mass,
moments of interia, and radii of gyration.
\item Explain how to change coordinate systems in integration, in
particular to a polar coordinates. Explain what the Jacobian of a
transformation is and how to use it.
\item Explain how to use Green's theorem to compute flow along and
flux across a curve.
