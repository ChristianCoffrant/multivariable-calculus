%\item ...
%\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Find limits and determine where functions of several variables
  are continuous.
\item Compute partial derivatives.  Use them to find tangent lines and
  tangent planes.
\item Be able to find the derivative of a function (as a matrix) and
  use it to find tangent planes.
\item Find derivatives of composite functions using the chain rule
  (matrix multiplication). In addition, find derivatives when
  constraints are in a problem.
\end{enumerate}
