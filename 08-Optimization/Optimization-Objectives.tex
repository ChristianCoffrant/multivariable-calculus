% A list of objectives for the chapter
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item ...
%\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Explain the properties of the gradient, its relation to level
  curves and level surfaces, and how it can be used to find
  directional derivatives.  
\item Find equations of tangent planes using the gradient and level
  surfaces. Use the derivative (tangent planes) to approximate
  functions, and use this in real world application problems.
\item Explain the second derivative test in terms of eigenvalues.
  Illustrate how eigenvalues and eigenvectors are used to optimize
  functions of several variables.
\item Use Lagrange multipliers to optimize a function subject to
  constraints.  Explain why Lagrange multipliers works by considering
  the gradients of the function and the constraint at a maximum.
